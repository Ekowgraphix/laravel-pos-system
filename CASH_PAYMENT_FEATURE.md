## 📄 Files Modified

### 1. **Checkout Page**
**File**: `resources/views/user/checkout.blade.php`

**Changes**:
- Added cash payment button
- Added cash icon to payment methods
- Updated button layout (2 payment options now)

```blade
<!-- Cash Payment -->
<form action="{{ route('payment.cash', $order) }}" method="POST">
    @csrf
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-success btn-lg w-100">
        <i class="fas fa-money-bill-wave me-2"></i>Pay with Cash
    </button>
</form>
```

### 2. **Payment Controller**
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/PaymentController.php`

**New Method**: `cashPayment()`

**What it does**:
- Validates order ownership
- Marks order as paid
- Sets `payment_status` = "completed"
- Sets `payment_method` = "Cash"
- Generates PDF invoice
- Redirects to receipt with auto-print flag

```php
public function cashPayment(Order $order)
{
    // Mark order as paid
    $order->update([
        'status' => 1,
        'payment_status' => 'completed',
        'paid_at' => now(),
        'payment_method' => 'Cash',
    ]);

    // Generate invoice
    $this->invoiceGenerator->generate($order);

    // Redirect with auto-print flag
    return redirect()->route('customerOrders', $order->order_code)
        ->with('auto_print', true);
}
```

### 3. **Routes**
**File**: `routes/web.php`

**New Route**:
```php
Route::post('/cash/{order}', [PaymentController::class, 'cashPayment'])
    ->name('payment.cash');
```

### 4. **Receipt Page (Auto-Print)**
**File**: `resources/views/user/userOrderDetails.blade.php`

**Added**: Auto-print JavaScript

```blade
@if(session('auto_print'))
<script>
    window.addEventListener('load', function() {
        setTimeout(function() {
            window.print(); // Opens print dialog automatically
        }, 500);
    });
</script>
@endif
```

### 5. **Order Model**
**File**: `app/Models/Order.php`

**Added**: `payment_method` to fillable array

```php
protected $fillable = [
    'product_id',
    'user_id',
    'status',
    'order_code',
    'payment_status',
    'payment_method', // NEW
    'paid_at',
    // ...
];
```

### 6. **Database Migration**
**File**: `database/migrations/2025_10_21_113316_add_payment_fields_to_orders_table.php`

**Added**: `payment_method` column

```php
Schema::table('orders', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->string('payment_method')->nullable()->after('payment_status');
});
```
