# 🖼️ Image Upload Display Issue - FIXED!

## 🐛 Problem
After updating a product, the uploaded image couldn't be seen properly on the edit page. The image and upload instructions were overlapping.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### What Was Wrong:
1. **Image overlay issue**: The product image and upload instructions were both visible at the same time
2. **No conditional display**: System didn't differentiate between "has image" and "no image" states
3. **Poor UX**: Users couldn't see their uploaded images clearly

### What Was Fixed:

#### 1. **CSS Improvements**
- Added `.has-image` and `.no-image` classes for proper state management
- Made upload instructions **absolutely positioned** and centered
- Hidden instructions when image exists
- Added **hover effect** to show upload instructions over dimmed image

#### 2. **Smart Display Logic**
```css
.product-preview.no-image {
    display: none;  /* Hide image when it's just the placeholder */
}

.image-upload-zone.has-image #uploadInstructions {
    display: none;  /* Hide instructions when image exists */
}

.image-upload-zone.has-image:hover #uploadInstructions {
    display: block;  /* Show on hover with dark overlay */
    background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);
}
```

#### 3. **JavaScript Enhancement**
- Added `checkImageExists()` function that runs on page load
- Automatically detects if product has real image or placeholder
- Applies appropriate classes dynamically
- Updates display when new image is selected

```javascript
function checkImageExists() {
    const imagePreview = document.getElementById('imagePreview');
    const uploadZone = document.getElementById('imageUploadZone');
    
    if (imagePreview.src && !imagePreview.src.includes('default.jpg')) {
        uploadZone.classList.add('has-image');
        imagePreview.classList.add('has-image');
    } else {
        uploadZone.classList.remove('has-image');
        imagePreview.classList.add('no-image');
    }
}
```

## 🎨 New Behavior

### **When Product Has Image (Edit Mode)**
- ✅ **Image displays clearly** without text overlay
- ✅ **Hover to see upload option**: Instructions appear with dark overlay when you hover
- ✅ **Image dims on hover**: Becomes 30% opacity to show you can change it
- ✅ **Click anywhere to change**: Upload new image

### **When No Image (Create Mode)**
- ✅ **Upload instructions visible**: Clear "Click to upload or drag image" text
- ✅ **No placeholder image showing**: Clean upload zone
- ✅ **After selecting image**: Automatically switches to "has-image" mode
